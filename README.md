<b>Description</b>

This is a jigsaw puzzle game used to train my skills. I didnÂ´t use any framework to build it, just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

<b>How to use deploy it</b>

Just download the zip file and extract its content wherever you want. The main screen will be opened in your default web browser -you do not need a web server.

<b>How to use it</b>

Execute the <i>index.html</i> file by double-clicking it and a welcome screen with a simple menu will come up. There you can select whether you want to set a new game or load a saved one. You can also select the language through the top-right flags.

If you select a new game, a couple of new screens will come up for you to set up your new puzzle.

<ul>
  <li>First, you will see a slider with a number of nice pictures. Just select one of them to play</li>
  <li>Then you can select the size of the puzzle -16/25/32 or 64 tiles</li>
</ul>

If you want to load a saved game from the Local Storage, you can select the Load game option.

<b>Playing it!</b>

The puzzle area is divided into two sections. On the left section you will see an empty frame where the puzzle will be built, and on the right one the puzzle tiles shuffled and ready to use. Just drag the tiles and drop them onto the frame. On top of the screen you will find a toolbar to help you complete it, as well as other options:

<ul>
  <li>A refresh button to randomly shuffle the tiles</li>
  <li>A view button to show the picture (faded)/hide it in the puzzle frame</li>
  <li>A grid button to show/hide the the grid in the puzzle frame</li>
  <li>A save button to store the game items in the Local Storage</li>
</ul>

Just download and enjoy!

I am a professional developer, and web developer as a hobby (for the moment ;-). So, any comments and improvement ideas will be welcome!
