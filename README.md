# puzzland v1.0

<b>Description</b>

This is a jigsaw puzzle game used to train my skills, it´s not perfect. It´s not using any framework, just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.

<b>How to use it</b>

First of all, a welcome screen with a simple menu comess up. There you can select if you want to set a new game or resume a saved one.
If you select a new one, a couple of new screens come up for you to set up your new puzzle.

<ul>
  <li>
  </li>
</ul>

To complete the puzzle, just drag and drop the randomly distributed tiles from the right panel to the left one, where you will find a 
frame containing the selected image (initially hidden).
You get some help in the top toolbar in order to make visible (faded) the image and the grid.

Just download and enjoy!

I am a professional developer, and web developer as a hobby (for the moment ;-). So, any comments and improvement ideas will be welcome!
