# puzzland v1.0

This is a jigsaw puzzle game used to train my skills, it´s not perfect. It´s not using any framework, just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The game consists on a couple of guided steps to select an image and a size before the main screen comes up. 

To complete the puzzle, just drag and drop the randomly distributed tiles from the right panel to the left one, where you will find a 
frame containing the selected image (initially hidden).
You get some help in the top toolbar in order to make visible (faded) the image and the grid.

Just download and enjoy!

I am a professional developer, and web developer as a hobby (for the moment ;-). So, any comments and improvement ideas will be welcome!
