# puzzland v1.0

This is a jigsaw puzzle game used to train my skills, it´s not perfect. It´s not using any framework, just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The game consists on a couple of guided steps to select image and size before the main screen comes up. 
To complete the puzzle, just drag and drop the randomly distributed tiles from the right panel to the left one, where you will find a 
frame containing the selected image (initially hidden).
You have some help in the top toolbar to make visible (faded) the image and the grid.

Just download and enjoy!
Any comments and improvements ideas will be welcome!
